Task Description and Requirements
This proposal addresses the development of a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm designed to fulfill the following specific criteria:
1.	GPU/ASIC RESISTANCE
The algorithm must be inherently resistant to parallelization, effectively discouraging mining performance advantages gained through GPU or ASIC hardware acceleration.
2.	TIP5 CRYPTOGRAPHY
The algorithm must use the Tip5 hashing standard, preserving its cryptographic integrity and security strength.
3.	CPU OPTIMIZATION
The algorithm should exhibit optimized performance on standard CPU architectures, aiming to validate a single hash operation within approximately 200 microseconds on high-end contemporary CPU hardware.

Meeting mandatory requirements (1) and (2) is essential. Achieving requirement (3) is highly desirable and will significantly enhance practical applicability.
